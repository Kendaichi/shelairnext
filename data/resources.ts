All joins must be sealed and coved to prevent harbourage of bacteria.",

PU foam has a thermal conductivity of approximately 0.022 W/mK and provides excellent structural rigidity. It is resistant to moisture absorption and maintains its insulating properties over decades. PU panels are suitable for all temperature ranges from coolrooms to deep freeze applications.",
          "Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) panels are lower cost but significantly less effective as an insulator — with a thermal conductivity of approximately 0.038 W/mK, you need nearly double the thickness to achieve the same R-value as PU. EPS is also more susceptible to moisture absorption over time, which degrades its insulating performance. It is not recommended for freezer applications.",

PIR panels typically cost 15–20% more than PU but deliver the best long-term energy performance.",

For blast freezers and pharmaceutical applications, 200mm PIR panels provide optimal performance.",

An alert sent at 11pm allows a staff member to transfer stock or call an emergency technician — rather than discovering the problem at 7am when the damage is done.",
          "Our clients report that monitoring systems pay for themselves within the first prevented stock loss event. For businesses with high-value stock — fresh seafood, premium meat, pharmaceutical products — the business case is straightforward: a $3,000–$5,000 monitoring installation is cheap insurance against losses that can run to multiples of that cost from a single incident.",

          "Beyond emergency alerts, continuous monitoring data reveals patterns that are invisible to manual checks. A system that runs continuously from 2am–6am every night is showing a symptom — perhaps a blocked condenser coil causing extended recovery times, or a door being left open by cleaning staff. A system with unusually high variance around its set point may have a failing expansion valve.",
          "Our clients who deploy monitoring consistently identify and rectify efficiency issues 3–4 months earlier than those relying on manual checks. At typical Queensland electricity rates, an efficiency improvement of even 10% on a $15,000/year refrigeration electricity bill saves $1,500 annually — every year.",

          "For businesses subject to food safety audits, IoT monitoring transforms HACCP documentation from a burdensome manual process to an automatic, defensible record. Every temperature reading is timestamped and stored in the cloud — typically for 2+ years — and can be exported as a report for any time period on demand.",
          "During an EHO inspection, you can instantly produce a 90-day temperature record for every cold room and display case in your business. Corrective actions are automatically logged when alarms are acknowledged. This level of documentation would take hours to compile manually — with monitoring, it takes seconds.",

          "A basic monitoring system for a single cold room — one wireless temperature sensor, cloud connectivity and mobile alerts — typically costs $800–$1,500 installed. For a business with 5–10 monitoring points (multiple cold rooms, display cases and a freezer), expect $3,000–$6,000 for a professionally installed system with a quality cloud platform.",
          "Ongoing costs vary by platform — some charge a monthly SaaS fee of $50–$150/month for the cloud dashboard and alerting, while others have no ongoing fees after installation. Over a 5-year period, total cost of ownership typically ranges from $5,000–$15,000 for a medium-sized food business.",
          "When weighed against a single prevented stock loss event ($5,000–$20,000) and the ongoing benefits of energy savings and compliance automation, the ROI for most businesses is measured in months, not years.
